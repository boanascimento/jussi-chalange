# After building app

## Figma Design

The project was inspired on [this Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/O9AEeYB6ZWyMTZzMZhvjaY/loja-vtex-jussi?node-id=0%3A1).

## Used search API

The project it's using the [Github Search User API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/users). There is no a logic reason to use that API, it was used just to meet the requirement to perform an API search.

## Search for a Github User

To invoque the Github API, you just need to type some Github user in the "Buscar" input field located on the NavBar on top of the web page, press `Enter` or click on magnifying glass button.
After that, you'll have a modal according on the response for the given value.
